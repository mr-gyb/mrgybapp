# Facebook HTTPS Solution - Proxy Approach

## ðŸš¨ **Problem Solved!**

Since Vite's built-in HTTPS wasn't working properly, I've created a custom HTTPS proxy solution that will work reliably for Facebook integration.

## âœ… **What I Created**

1. **Custom HTTPS Proxy Server** - `scripts/https-proxy.js`
2. **Updated Package Scripts** - New workflow for HTTPS development
3. **Reliable HTTPS Setup** - Works with your Vite dev server

## ðŸš€ **How to Use**

### **Step 1: Generate SSL Certificates**
```bash
npm run generate-certs
```

### **Step 2: Start HTTPS Development**
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will:
- Start the HTTPS proxy server on `https://localhost:3000`
- Automatically start Vite dev server on `http://localhost:3001`
- Proxy all HTTPS requests to your Vite server

### **Alternative Commands**
- `npm run dev:https` - Same as `npm run dev`
- `npm run dev:http` - HTTP only (port 3001)

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works**

1. **HTTPS Proxy Server** runs on port 3000 with SSL certificates
2. **Vite Dev Server** runs on port 3001 (HTTP)
3. **Proxy** forwards all HTTPS requests from port 3000 to port 3001
4. **Facebook Integration** works because it sees HTTPS on port 3000

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Solution**

1. **Generate certificates** (if not done):
   ```bash
   npm run generate-certs
   ```

2. **Start HTTPS development**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access your app** at `https://localhost:3000`

4. **Accept security warning** (self-signed certificate)

5. **Test Facebook integration** - should work without HTTPS errors!

## ðŸ“± **Facebook App Settings**

Make sure your Facebook app has these OAuth redirect URIs:
- `https://localhost:3000/facebook-callback`
- `https://localhost:3000/settings/integrations/callback`

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits of This Approach**

- âœ… **Reliable HTTPS** - Custom proxy server
- âœ… **Facebook Compatible** - Meets HTTPS requirements
- âœ… **Easy to Use** - Single command: `npm run dev`
- âœ… **Development Friendly** - Hot reload still works
- âœ… **No Vite Issues** - Bypasses Vite HTTPS problems

## ðŸš¨ **If You Have Issues**

### **SSL Certificate Problems**
```bash
npm run generate-certs
```

### **Port Conflicts**
- Make sure ports 3000 and 3001 are free
- Check if other services are using these ports

### **Proxy Errors**
- Ensure Vite dev server is running on port 3001
- Check browser console for any proxy errors

## ðŸŽ‰ **Summary**

The solution is simple:
1. **Run `npm run dev`** (starts HTTPS proxy + Vite)
2. **Access via `https://localhost:3000`**
3. **Facebook integration will work!**

Your Facebook integration should now work properly with reliable HTTPS! ðŸš€
